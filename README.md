# Hubspot-Integration-with-Fastapi
 In this project, I built a full HubSpot integration using FastAPI and React. I implemented the OAuth flow, connected it to the frontend, and used my own HubSpot credentials for testing. After authentication, I fetched data from HubSpot APIs and displayed it as integration items, similar to other platforms.
